                    <h1>My First Blog: Building a Portfolio Website with AI</h1>
             <p>Hello, world! This marks my very first attempt at writing a blog, and I’m excited to share this experience with you. Instead of publishing on platforms like Medium, I decided to create my own website.
                 Why? Well, it was partly to challenge myself and partly to test how far Large Language Models (LLMs) have come in terms of usability and capability.
             Here’s the kicker: the platform you're reading this on was entirely created by an LLM,<strong>with zero coding on my part</strong> , and it took less than two hours.</p>
            <h3>The Process</h3>
        <p>Yes, you read that right—software engineers, take note! Using just a series of prompts (like "align the design this way" or "give me the code for this screenshot"), the LLM executed my instructions impressively. It even offered suggestions on how to improve the website, such as adding analytics or enhancing usability.</p>
<p>The star of this experiment? OpenAI’s O1-preview model, known for its thoughtful approach to programming tasks. What’s more, I got access to it through my university, UC Irvine, via their custom wrapper called ZotGPT. Shoutout to UCI for enabling this experiment!</p>

             <h3>Observations</h3>
            <p>Although the task was relatively simple—creating a static portfolio webpage—it underscored both the potential and limitations of LLMs. As my professor aptly points out, LLMs can handle straightforward parts of complex systems but aren’t quite ready to manage entire intricate architectures independently. For now, AI remains a tool that complements, not replaces, human expertise.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Write a Blog?</h3>
<p>This experiment wasn’t just about testing AI; it also gave me the perfect excuse to write my first blog. Going forward, I plan to write about topics that genuinely excite me—whether they’re cutting-edge developments or nostalgic musings. Think of this blog as a time capsule, preserving thoughts and experiences to revisit in the future.</p>
    <p>Here’s to more experiments, discoveries, and, of course, blogs!</p>

            <p>(P.S.: Below are some screenshots of my interaction with the O1-preview model, showcasing how it all came together.)</p>
